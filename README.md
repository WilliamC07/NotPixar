## Description
To create a platform for people to share their artwork similar to Imgur, Tumblr, and Reddit. Users will create pixel arts, which will automatically be shared with others. Most websites are based on creating artwork on an external application then uploaded online. This website will combine those two steps to increase availability and ease to use.
